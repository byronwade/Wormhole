- Align reads to fixed 128KB chunks and address by ChunkId.
- Add RAM LRU cache for hot chunks; serve cache hits without network.
- Prefetch sequential chunks (governor heuristics) to stay ahead of reads.
- Stitch multi-chunk reads in FUSE; keep RO semantics.
- Observe sequential workloads (cp/video) showing ahead-of-need fetches.
