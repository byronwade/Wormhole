# Wormhole Project Context

## What We're Building

**Wormhole** is a P2P distributed filesystem that mounts remote folders locally via QUIC.

**One-liner:** "AirDrop meets network drive - share a folder with a code, others mount it as a local drive."

## Target Audience

**Primary:** Creative Professionals (Video Editors, Game Developers, VFX Artists)

**Why They Need This:**
- 50GB render = 30+ min cloud upload → Wormhole: <10 seconds
- $50+/month for Dropbox + Frame.io → Wormhole: $0
- Privacy concerns with cloud → Wormhole: Files never leave your network

**Personas:**
1. **Freelance Video Editor** - Wants to mount render farm output while editing
2. **Indie Game Developer** - Wants to share builds without Perforce costs
3. **VFX Studio Lead** - Wants to replace expensive sync tools

## Development Phases

| Phase | Goal | Key Work |
|-------|------|----------|
| 1 | `ls -R` remote files | FUSE skeleton, metadata sync |
| 2 | Read remote files | Data plane, byte requests |
| 3 | Streaming + cache | Governor prefetch, RAM cache |
| 4 | Offline access | Disk cache, LRU eviction |
| 5 | Desktop app | Tauri GUI, installers |
| 6 | Global access | NAT traversal, PAKE encryption |
| 7 | Full sync | Bidirectional writes, locks |

## Key Technologies

- **Rust** - Core implementation
- **FUSE (fuser crate)** - Filesystem in userspace
- **QUIC (quinn + rustls)** - Encrypted multiplexed transport
- **PAKE (spake2)** - Join code → encryption key
- **Tauri v2** - Desktop app wrapper
- **React + Vite + Tailwind** - Frontend
