| Name | Hex | Usage |
|------|-----|-------|
| **Wormhole Purple** | `#7C3AED` | Primary brand, CTAs, links |
| **Nebula Pink** | `#EC4899` | Accents, gradients |

### Typography

- **Monospace:** JetBrains Mono (join codes, technical)
- **Hero:** 72px Bold
- **H1:** 48px Bold
- **Body:** 16px Regular

### Voice & Tone
- **Technical but accessible** - Explain without dumbing down
- **Direct** - Short sentences, no corporate speak
- **Slightly irreverent** - Question the status quo
- **Confident but not arrogant** - "It just works" not "We're the best"

## Messaging Framework

### Primary Tagline
> **"Mount Any Folder. Any Computer. No Setup."**

### Alternative Taglines
| Context | Tagline |
|---------|---------|
| Technical | "P2P file sharing that actually mounts as a drive" |
| Anti-Cloud | "Your files. Your network. No middleman." |
| Simplicity | "Share a code. That's it." |
| Cost | "Stop paying rent on your own files" |
| Speed | "Why upload when you can connect?" |

### Value Props by Audience

**Video Editors:**
> "Stop waiting 30 minutes for your 50GB render to upload. Mount your render farm's output folder and start editing while files are still rendering."

**Game Developers:**
> "Mount your build server's output folder - test instantly on all platforms. Replace Perforce for asset-only shares (free!)."

**Privacy-Conscious:**
> "Your files never touch a third-party server. End-to-end encrypted. Open source."

**Cost-Conscious:**
> "Save $500-2,000/year vs. cloud storage. Free forever."

### Elevator Pitches

**10 seconds:**
> "Wormhole lets you mount any folder from any computer as if it were local. Share a code, connect, done. No cloud, no accounts, no fees."

**30 seconds:**
> "Imagine if you could take any folder on your computer and make it appear on someone else's machine - not as a sync, but as a live mount. That's Wormhole. A video editor can mount their render farm's output folder and edit files as they finish rendering. No cloud uploads, no waiting, no monthly bills."

## Target Audience

### Primary: Creative Professionals

**Demographics:**
- Age: 25-50
- macOS + Windows
- Adobe/DaVinci/Blender/Unreal ecosystem
- Freelance or small studio (2-10 people)
- Tech-comfortable but prefer GUI over CLI

**Pain Points:**
- 4K video = 20-22GB/hour, 30+ min upload
- Frame.io + Dropbox = $50+/month
- Syncthing requires 15+ config steps
- Constant version control conflicts

**User Personas:**
1. **Alex** (32, Freelance Video Editor, LA) - "If this actually mounts the folder live, I'll never use WeTransfer again."
2. **Sam** (28, Indie Game Dev, Berlin) - "Syncthing would be perfect if it didn't take 2 hours to set up."
3. **Jordan** (45, VFX Studio Lead, Toronto) - "If it's free and actually works, we'll switch tomorrow."

## Pricing Strategy

## Messaging Don'ts

| Don't Say | Why | Say Instead |
|-----------|-----|-------------|
| "Disrupting the cloud" | Cliché | "Direct peer-to-peer" |
| "Revolutionary" | Overused | "Simple" or "Fast" |
| "Seamless" | Meaningless | Be specific: "One-click" |
| "Leverage" | Corporate speak | "Use" |
| "Best-in-class" | Unverifiable | Cite specific metric |
