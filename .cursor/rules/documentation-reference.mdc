# Documentation Reference (ALWAYS CONSULT)

## Critical Rule

**BEFORE writing any code or making decisions**, consult the relevant documentation. This project has extensive planning docs that MUST guide implementation.

## Master Plan (READ FIRST)

**`doc/development/00-master-implementation-plan.md`** - The source of truth for:
- Development phases and their order
- What features belong in which phase
- Dependencies between components
- Success criteria for each phase

## When to Consult Which Doc

| Task | Read First |
|------|------------|
| **Starting any coding** | `00-master-implementation-plan.md` |
| **Implementing a phase** | `phase-X/1-overview.md` through `10-notes.md` |
| **Writing tests** | `01-testing-strategy.md` |
| **Security decisions** | `02-security-guide.md` |
| **Why we chose X** | `03-architecture-decisions.md` |
| **Wire protocol work** | `04-protocol-specification.md` |
| **API design** | `05-api-reference.md` |
| **Debugging issues** | `06-troubleshooting.md` |
| **Performance work** | `07-performance-benchmarks.md` |
| **Deploying to prod** | `08-deployment-guide.md` |
| **UI/UX design** | `02-brand-identity.md` |
| **Writing copy** | `01-target-audience-strategy.md` + `02-brand-identity.md` |

## Phase Documentation Structure

Each phase folder contains:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `1-overview.md` | What this phase accomplishes |
| `2-goals.md` | Success criteria |
| `3-architecture.md` | Technical design |
| `4-scope.md` | What's in/out of scope |
| `5-implementation-plan.md` | Step-by-step tasks |
| `6-testing-and-metrics.md` | How to verify |
| `7-risks-and-mitigations.md` | What could go wrong |
| `8-deliverables.md` | What gets shipped |
| `9-open-questions.md` | Unresolved decisions |
| `10-notes.md` | Additional context |

## Mandatory Checks

### Before Coding
1. ✅ Check `00-master-implementation-plan.md` for current phase
2. ✅ Read the phase's `4-scope.md` to verify feature belongs here
3. ✅ Check `5-implementation-plan.md` for how it should be built
4. ✅ Review `02-security-guide.md` if handling paths/network/crypto

### Before UI Work
1. ✅ Read `02-brand-identity.md` for colors, typography, voice
2. ✅ Check `01-target-audience-strategy.md` for user context
3. ✅ Review `phase-5-product-wrapper/4-frontend-architecture.md`

### Before Marketing/Copy
1. ✅ Read `02-brand-identity.md` for tone and messaging
2. ✅ Check `01-target-audience-strategy.md` for personas
3. ✅ Review `08-monetization-strategy.md` for pricing claims

## Never Forget

- **Don't reinvent** - The docs have answers
- **Don't skip phases** - Each builds on the last
- **Don't guess pricing** - It's calculated in `08-monetization-strategy.md`
- **Don't guess voice** - It's defined in `02-brand-identity.md`
- **Don't guess architecture** - It's in the phase docs
