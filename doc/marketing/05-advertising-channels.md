Hey r/VideoEditing,

I was tired of waiting for renders to upload before I could start editing,
so I built something to fix it.

[GIF/Video of mounting folder, opening file]

How it works:
1. Run Wormhole on render machine, drag in folder
2. Get a code like 7KJM-XBCD-QRST-VWYZ
3. On laptop, enter code, folder appears in Finder

No cloud, no upload time, just... there.

Free and open source if anyone wants to try it: [link]

**Problem Awareness Thread:**
```
Thread: Why I stopped using Dropbox (and what I use instead)

1/ For 5 years I paid $12/month for Dropbox.

Then I realized: I was paying rent to store MY files on THEIR servers.

Here's what changed 🧵

2/ The wake-up call:
- 50GB render = 30 min upload
- 50GB download = 30 min again
- Total wait: 1 hour
- Just to share files I already had

3/ The math:
- $12/month × 12 months = $144/year
- × 5 years = $720
- For files I could just... directly share

4/ What I do now:
- Share a code
- Other person mounts my folder
- No upload. No download. No bill.

[Screenshot]

5/ The tool: Wormhole
- Free, open source
- Works on Mac, Windows, Linux
- E2E encrypted
- No third-party servers

Link: [url]

6/ Not saying cloud storage is always bad.
But for sharing files you already have?
There's a better way.

Title: Show HN: Wormhole – Mount any folder from any computer with a code

Body:
Hi HN,

I built Wormhole because I was tired of waiting for cloud uploads.

It lets you share any folder with a code. Others can mount it as a local
drive on their machine - no upload, no download, files just appear.

Tech stack: Rust, QUIC, FUSE, PAKE for key exchange

Use cases:
- Video editors mounting render farm output
- Game devs sharing builds with testers
- Anyone who wants Dropbox without the cloud

Free and open source: [GitHub link]
Demo video: [link]

Would love feedback on the architecture and UX.
```

**HN Rules:**
1. **Don't ask for upvotes** - Instant ban risk
2. **Engage substantively** - Answer every question thoroughly
3. **Be humble** - HN hates hype
4. **Technical depth wins** - Share implementation details
5. **Timing matters** - Don't post on weekends
