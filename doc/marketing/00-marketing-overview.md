## Quick Reference

### Primary Target Audience

**Creative Professionals** (Video Editors, Game Developers, VFX Artists)

**Why:**
- Highest pain intensity (cloud costs, sync delays)
- Fastest buying decision (indie/freelance)
- Strongest word-of-mouth (active communities)
- Clearest "aha moment" (mount works → instant convert)

### Brand Essence

| Element | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Primary Color** | Wormhole Purple (#7C3AED) |
| **Tagline** | "Mount Any Folder. Any Computer. No Setup." |
| **Voice** | Technical but accessible, direct, slightly irreverent |
| **Logo Concept** | Portal/wormhole with flow element |

### Key Differentiators

| vs. Competitor | Wormhole Advantage |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Dropbox | No monthly fees, no cloud intermediary |
| Syncthing | No 15-step config, join codes instead of peer IDs |
| AirDrop | Cross-platform, works over internet, mounts as drive |
| Resilio | Free (not $95), simpler |
| Frame.io | No per-seat pricing, P2P instead of cloud |

### Go-to-Market Phases
