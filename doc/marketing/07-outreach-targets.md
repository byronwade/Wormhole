Subject: Faster render access for [Studio Name]

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Studio Name] does a lot of [VFX/color/finishing] work.
Curious if you've ever been frustrated by render sync times?

I'm building Wormhole - it lets you mount folders from render
machines directly, so editors can start working on files while
they're still rendering. No upload, no cloud, just appears.

Would love to show you a quick demo. 5 minutes, no commitment.

If you're not the right person, would you mind pointing me to
whoever manages your pipeline/workflow?

Thanks,
[Name]

Subject: Faster build distribution for [Studio Name]

Hi [Name],

Congrats on [recent game/update] - been playing it and love [specific detail].

I'm building a tool for game devs to share builds without cloud uploads.
Mount your build server's output folder directly, test instantly.

Some indie devs are using it to replace Perforce for asset-only shares
(way simpler, and free).

Would love to show you a demo if you're interested.

Best,

Subject: Sponsorship inquiry - Wormhole (P2P file tool)

Hi [Name],

Big fan of your [specific video/content] - especially [specific detail].

I'm building Wormhole, a free tool that lets you mount any folder
from any computer with a code. Think AirDrop but cross-platform
and it mounts as a drive instead of transferring.

For [video editors/game devs], it means:
- Mount render farm output while files are still rendering
- Share builds with testers without cloud uploads
- No monthly fees like Dropbox/Frame.io

Would love to discuss a sponsorship or honest review.

Budget: $[X] for [30-sec mention / dedicated video]

Happy to send more info or do a demo call.

Best,
[Name]

Subject: Story pitch - Open source Dropbox alternative

Hi [Editor],

Quick pitch for [Publication]:

Wormhole is an open-source tool that lets you mount any folder
from any computer - like Dropbox, but files never leave your
machine.

The angle: Cloud storage companies charge monthly fees to store
files users already have locally. Wormhole lets users skip the
upload entirely.

Story hooks:
- Privacy angle: Files never touch third-party servers
- Open source angle: Built in Rust, FUSE-based
- Economic angle: Saving $100s/year vs. cloud storage

Happy to provide:
- Demo access
- Technical deep dive
- User quotes

Let me know if interested.

Best,
[Name]
