- Host data: 5MB video.bin via dd; include smaller text/binary for sanity.
- Run host/client; cp ./mnt/video.bin ./local_copy.bin; expect log prefetches [1..n].
- dd skip into mid-chunk (e.g., skip=20 bs=128k count=1) to see priority + next chunk prefetch.
- Verify md5sum host vs mounted copy.
- Metrics: cache hit rate, prefetch hit rate, fetch latency p50/p99, wasted bytes (prefetch not used).
