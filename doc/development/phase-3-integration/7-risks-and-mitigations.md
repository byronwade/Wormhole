- Prefetch blocking priority path: move prefetch to background tasks; cap concurrent prefetches.
- RAM pressure: tune cache capacity; expose config; monitor eviction churn.
- Non-sequential workloads: governor should reset streak quickly; avoid over-prefetch.
- Large files over slow links: consider gating prefetch count by bandwidth/RTT.
